            <p class="about">The sounds on the Natural Language ep exist across many spectra of sonic parameters. Perhaps one of the most
            prevalent of these spectra is the relationship between rhythm and drone, or discrete musical
            notes versus sustained sonorities. As the tracks progress through the record, they explore the
            extremities of this spectrum – often featuring pounding, tumbling rhythms or crushing, droning
            noise – and the poetry of the music exists somewhere in the middle. Through this
            pseudo-spectromorphological approach, I composed the tracks on this EP with the idea of
            blends (in every sense of the word) in mind. How might different genres blend together to
            create a hybrid style? How might a dj blend these tracks with other music? How might noise,
            rhythm, pitch, and texture blend together to form a kind of primordial ooze from which a new,
            personal musical language might find its first steps.</p>

            <p class="about">The release also comes with a free download of a custom Max-for-Live device, developed by
            Christopher Lock, which is inspired by the sounds on the record. The device is a kind of
            sound-design generation tool, made from two granulators loaded with samples from the ep. It is
            intended to be used as a way to experiment, brainstorm, and invent new sounds which then
            might be resampled and used in other contexts. By including this custom M4L device, I hope to
            give the musical ideas which I explore on this ep a second life, extended beyond the static
            recordings. The textures, gestures, and granular phrases which make up the syntax of the
            music on the ep continue to live through the instrument, beyond what has been committed to
            the recording.</p>
