            <p class="about">This piece was created in collaboration with Gary Lock, the director of the University of Oxford School of Archaeology’s excavation project at Moel Y Gaer, Bodfari in the fall of 2016. Moel Y Gaer, Bodfari is an iron age hill fort located in northern wales.
                The project to explore, uncover, and document the landmark was started in 2011 by the School Of Archaeology at Oxford and is ongoing. The diagrams below show “different types of maps/plans/photos” (Gary Lock, Kellog College) of the excavation site and were provided by the school.</p>

            <img src="Images/Moel_White.avif" class="center">

            <p class="about">The piece was conceived by converting these diagrams into Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files and constructing them in a graphical music notation software called Iannix. Once reconstructed, I was able to allocate different nodes (blue dots) throughout the structure based on points of interest found in excavation.
                There are dozens of orange cursors that move along the lines of the map. Once they pass a node, a message is sent to Max/MSP (music production software) which triggers a specific sound based on which node is struck.</p>

        <p class="about">The Piece is focused around the idea that one work of art can be directly influenced,
            and in some cases dictated, by data. In this case, a piece of music that is the product of modern and sophisticated musical technology
            is directly influenced and structured by data from ancient architecture. The music attempts to capture this juxtaposition of the old and new and is
            meant to create an almost web-like cloud of texture that is constantly morphing and assuming new dramatic qualities as the cursors move through the map.</p>

            <p class="about">This piece has been performed/presented in both installation and traditional concert settings. However,
                I have found more success in installation settings.</p>
