        <p class="about2">Christopher Lock is a computer musician, creative programmer, and film composer currently based in Cambridge, MA.
        He creates densely textural electronic music which slowly mutates and morphs over time and is often saturated with dark imagery or phantasmagoria.
        His musical practice stems from a tradition of Baltimore area noise music, where he first started experimenting with sound.</p>

        <p class="about2">Through out his education Christopher has been fortunate to study with such musical visionaries as Esperanza Spalding, Meredith Monk, Vijay Iyer,
        Claire Chase, Thomas Dolby, Chaya Czernowin, Hans Tutschku.</p>

        <p class="about2">In the summer of 2019 his audio/visual work, in collaboration with his grandmother (also called Chris Lock), was screened at
        the Venice Biennale from May 8th to June 4th. The video was projected in the Palazzo Pesaro Papafava as part of the UK's.</p>

        <p class="about2">In April of 2022 Christopher produced and performed original electronic music for LuChen's debut runway show in Manhattan,
        which was later reviewed positively by Vogue Magazine, Fashion Week, and other major publications.</p>

        <p class="about2">Christopher is currently a Ph.D candidate in Music and Computer Science at Harvard University.  He  holds a Master’s Degree in Computer Music from Harvard,
