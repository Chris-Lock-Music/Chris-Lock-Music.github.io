        <p>The title of this piece was based upon a discussion with composer Steven Takasugi in the fall of 2019.</p>

        <p>The piece was writter for and performed by the MIT Laptop Ensemble also known as faMLE.  It runs on custom designed Max/MSP instruments that use data from the laptop trackpad
            to control different parameters of the sound.</p>

            <p>The four laptops are each connected to an indevidual transducer which is placed inside of the piano and resonates the strings and body of the instrument in different ways.
                The piano pedal is fixed down for the majority of the piece.  A subwoofer is also placed below the piano.  This piecce explores the acousticization of electronic sounds and gestures.</p>
