        <p>FLICKERSCAPE is an interactive audio visual artpiece based in the web browser. It was created by Christopher Lock in 2020 and was written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Web Audio API and the HTML audio tag for all
            of the sounds and CSS animations and JavaScript for the visuals. FLICKERSCAPE is currently not mobile freindly and for optimal experience headphones are recomended. It was created as an attempt to turn the practice of experimental
            audio mixing into a kind of game.</p>
            <p>The FLICKERSCAPE repository can be freely pulled from Github via the following link: <a href="https://github.com/Chris-Lock-Music/Flickerscape" target="_blank">https://github.com/Chris-Lock-Music/Flickerscape</a></p>

        <p>Your objective/role in this audiovisual artpiece will be more than that of a mere audince member. Your goal will be to move your curser around the FLICKERSCAPE in search of rectangles that turn red when
             you hover over them. When you click these rectangles new sounds will be added to the sonic texture and the rectangle will minimize until you have found and clicked another one! But be warned, it is intentionally
             difficult to locate/acurately click these buttons while the rest of the grid is moving around.</p>

         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-lXlk4uqXk&t=12s" target="_blank">
            <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5c8c7d5099e60684106be3db685beb17/bad0ee4451400c39-79/s2048x3072/64f7043d339f8ce3450fbcaa745e1724cbc10c34.pnj"
            alt="HTML tutorial"  class="center">
            </a>

        <p>Also, the layout of the FLICKERSCAPE will change every 10 seconds make it even more difficult to navigate. Each new layout can be thought of as a new scene so to speak. If it wasn't hard to click them then it
            wouldn't be as rewarding and wouldn't be as fun, right? Clicking the buttons that you find makes you just as much the artist/composer of the piece as I am since you ultimately have much of the control over what
            the aesthetic outcome of the experience will be.</p>


        <p>When you are done playing simply close the tab and all audio will stop.</p>

            alt="HTML tutorial"  class="center">
            </a>

            <p>Once you have arrived on the homepage you will notice two different elements; the title: FLICKERSCAPE (which flickers red every couple of seconds), and an "about" tab to the upper left of the screen.
                Hover over the about tab if you would like to read more about the project.
                If you are ready to start playing simply click on the title. You will first be redirected to a strobe warning, then after 4 seconds the piece will begin.</p>
